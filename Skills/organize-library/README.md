# Organize Library

Fully organizes a SharePoint document library end-to-end. Classifies files by content type, applies brand-consistent column formatting, creates filtered views per content type, colors folders, and sets up notification rules for overdue items.

## What you get

- Files classified and metadata extracted using the **file-classifier** skill
- Color-coded classification pills, data bars on financial columns, and overdue highlighting on date columns
- A default view grouped by content type with styled group headers
- Per-content-type views (Contracts, Invoices, Purchase Orders) in the view picker
- Folder colors applied using brand colors from `SHAREPOINT.md`
- Automated notification rules that alert a reviewer when any document is flagged Overdue

## When to use

Ask Copilot:

- *"organize library"* / *"organize document library"*
- *"set up library"* / *"structure library"*
- *"brand library"* / *"apply brand to library"*
- *"full library makeover"* / *"organize and format library"*

Best on a document library that already contains a mix of contracts, invoices, and purchase orders. The skill orchestrates the [file-classifier](../file-classifier/) skill end-to-end and reads `SHAREPOINT.md` for brand colors — if no `SHAREPOINT.md` is present, a fallback palette is used (see the skill instructions).

## Demo content

Sample files for trying this skill end-to-end are in the [demo/](./demo/) subfolder. Includes a mix of contracts, invoices, and purchase orders to upload to a library before running the skill. Skip this folder when uploading the skill to SharePoint.
